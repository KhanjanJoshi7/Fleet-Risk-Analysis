# Fleet-Risk-Analysis

Truck Fleet Risk Analysis - Big Data Analytics Project
🚛 Project Overview
This big data analytics project analyzes truck fleet data to identify risk factors, dangerous driving patterns, and provide actionable insights for minimizing traffic accidents and improving fleet safety. The analysis covers driver behavior, geographical risk assessment, truck model performance, and predictive modeling using big data technologies.

🎯 Problem Statement
Truck-related traffic accidents are a major source of fatalities and injuries. A trucking business has committed to analyzing fleet data and implementing appropriate damage-minimization strategies to solve this critical safety problem.

📊 Project Objectives
1. Driver Analysis
Identify the most dangerous drivers based on overspeeding, lane deviation, and unsafe following distances
Rank drivers by risk factors and violation patterns
2. Geographical Analysis
Evaluate relative risk levels of California's riskiest cities
Compare regional risk patterns to determine high-risk zones
3. Truck Model Analysis
Evaluate and compare truck models using average risk factors and event counts
Identify safest and most dangerous vehicle models
4. Driving Incident Analysis
Analyze factors related to driving events and violations
Identify patterns in incident types and locations
5. Mileage/Speed Analysis
Categorize drivers into high and low-risk groups
Analyze relationships between total miles, maximum speed, and average mileage
6. Predictive Modeling
Develop linear regression models to predict driver risk factors
Identify significant variables influencing driver safety
